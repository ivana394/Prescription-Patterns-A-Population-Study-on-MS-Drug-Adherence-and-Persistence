# Introduction and Problem Description

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous
system and is one of the most common causes of disability among young adults (Wingerchuk
& Carter, 2014). Most often, the diagnosis is made in individuals between the ages of 20 and
40 (Jazbec, 2016), a period crucial for active participation in the workforce. According to
data from the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform, up to 80% of patients stop working
within 15 years of disease onset (European Multiple Sclerosis Platform [EMSP], 2015),
which can impact the economic and social aspects of society.
While there is no cure for MS, medications are available that can modify the course of the
disease, control it to some extent, and help manage symptoms. Consistent adherence to
prescribed doses plays a crucial role in managing disease progression, reducing relapse rates,
and slowing disability progression (Banks et al., 2019). This measurable phenomenon,
defined as adherence, is essential for positive health outcomes. Previous studies have
indicated suboptimal long-term adherence to medications that modify the course of chronic
diseases (Menzin et al., 2013). Injectable medications can pose adherence challenges due to
side effects, such as flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions (Agashivala et al., 2013;
Menzin et al., 2013). Current treatment guidelines emphasize the importance of early and
continuous use of prescribed immunomodulatory drugs (IMDs) from the time of diagnosis.
Early treatment has been shown to improve disease outcomes, reduce relapse rates, prevent
demyelinating lesions, and slow disease progression (Tan et al., 2011). In chronic diseases,
adherence to prescribed doses is crucial for influencing disease progression and,
consequently, healthcare costs for society (Menzin et al., 2013).
In recent years, there has been a growing trend in using pharmaceutical and healthcare
databases to monitor medication consumption (McKay et al., 2017). Various approaches have
been developed to identify medication usage intensity, discontinuation, and duration of
treatment.
The study by Hansen et al. (2015) presents an adherence analysis of four IMDs prescribed for
MS in Germany over a two-year period. Results showed that only 30-40% of patients
remained adherent two years after starting the medication. A similar study was conducted by
Setayeshgar et al. (2019) in Canada, where adherence was measured based on prescribed
6
doses for MS patients from 2011 to 2015. Findings indicated a high adherence rate (> 80%)
among patients who did not discontinue therapy during the first year.
In this research, we aim to evaluate and analyze the dynamics of prescribed IMD doses for
MS treatment based on a database of all issued prescriptions from 2011 to 2015. This data
enables a faster and more cost-effective research approach that includes a large sample. The
findings of this study provide insight into the dynamics of IMD use in MS treatment and aid
in planning prescription strategies for MS patients.

# Objectives and goals of the thesis

The purpose of this research is to analyze the usage dynamics of immunomodulatory drugs
(IMDs) and the demographic characteristics of MS patients receiving these drugs based on
prescription data. Using prescription data from Slovenia from 2011 to 2015, we aim to
evaluate adherence and persistence to these drugs.

Goals of the Thesis:

1. Analyze the prescribing trends of IMDs for MS patients.
2. Assess adherence to IMDs among MS patients.
3. Determine whether adherence to MS treatment with IMDs differs by drug
administration type.
4. Estimate the survival probability of specific IMDs until substitution or treatment
discontinuation (persistence).
5. Identify factors influencing adherence and persistence of IMDs for MS.

# Hypotheses

In chronic diseases, patient adherence to the prescribed therapeutic regimen impacts disease
outcomes. Therefore, treatments must be designed to be safe and effective for patients. Since
various IMDs are available on the market, we sought to evaluate adherence differences
between older injectable IMDs and newer oral IMDs, both of which are prescribed as firstline treatments. Additionally, we examined fingolimod, which has shown high efficacy,
7
particularly if administered at the onset of MS symptoms. Since fingolimod is prescribed as a
first-line drug in some countries and a second-line drug in others, we were interested in
comparing patient adherence to fingolimod with that of the other two drug types. 
The hypotheses we aim to test are:

• H_1: Adherence to oral IMDs prescribed for MS patients is higher than adherence to
injectable IMDs.

• H_2: Adherence to fingolimod is higher than adherence to other oral drugs.

• H_3: Adherence to fingolimod is higher than adherence to injectable drugs.

# Research methodology

## Research Methods and Statistical Analysis

Continuous numerical variables with normal distributions are presented with the mean and
standard deviation. For non-normally distributed variables, we report the median and 95%
confidence interval. Categorical variables are shown as absolute and relative frequencies.
Adherence was estimated based on the CMA5 method defined by Vollmer et al. (2012). The
permissible gap defining persistence in a therapeutic episode is set at 180 days. The length of
a therapeutic episode, or persistence, is defined as the period from the first prescription to the
last prescription plus the quantity dispensed at the last prescription, including any surplus or
medication stock.

Adherence is shown as the percentage of adherent therapeutic episodes, with a threshold of
90%. We used the function cma.per.episode from the AdhereR package, setting the
permissible gap to 180 days.

The estimated adherence is summarized with the median, mean, minimum, maximum, and
95% confidence interval. The proportion of adherent patients within each drug group at the
90% threshold is also displayed. Hypothesis evaluation was conducted using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. In cases where the test was statistically significant, we
performed post hoc analysis with Bonferroni correction for p-values. Paired tests for
evaluating adherence between drug groups for the same patient were conducted using the
non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The impact of independent variables on adherence
was modeled with multivariate logistic regression. The influences of selected independent
variables on the dichotomous variable CMA5 were modeled.

Patient persistence to drugs was illustrated with Kaplan-Meier survival curves, from which
the proportion of persistent patients was determined. The impact of independent variables on
non-persistence was assessed with multivariate Cox regression, where events defining the end
of persistence were classified as complete treatment discontinuation or drug substitution. The
analysis was conducted on both the entire study period and two separate periods within the
study: 2011–2013 and 2014–2015. Statistical significance of differences in times to treatment
substitution or discontinuation was assessed with the non-parametric Mantel-Cox log-rank
test.
9

Statistical significance is considered at p ≤ 0.05. The statistical analysis was performed using
RStudio (RStudio Team, 2021), R version 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2019), and IBM SPSS
Statistics version 27.0 (IBM Corp, 2017).

## Research Sample

The retrospective study was based on a database of outpatient prescriptions from 2011 to
2015. The prescription database includes demographic data of recipients and prescribers,
along with details of the issued prescriptions. For each prescription, the database records the
ATC code of the dispensed drug, its quantity, and the prescription issue date. Using the drug
code, we obtained the defined daily dose (DDD) per drug package from the Central
Medicines Database. Based on the DDD and the number of packages dispensed, we estimated
the DDD prescribed per prescription, which indicates the number of days for which the
prescribed drug is sufficient.

## Cohort Definition

MS medications were identified based on ATC codes with guidance from clinical experts.
The identified active substances in our data include interferon beta-1a (ATC L03AB07),
interferon beta-1b (ATC L03AB08), glatiramer acetate (ATC L03AX13), dimethyl fumarate
(ATC N07XX09), teriflunomide (ATC L04AA31), fingolimod (ATC L04AA27), natalizumab
(ATC L04AA23), and cladribine (ATC L01BB04).

The dataset preparation process and cohort design are illustrated in Figure 1.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align: center;">

![Figure 1: Cohort definition](kohort definition.png){width=50%} 
</div>
<br><br>

In Figure 1, we observe that the database contains 33,287 prescriptions for one of the
immunomodulatory drugs (IMDs) intended to modify the course of multiple sclerosis (MS).
A total of 1,634 individuals received these 33,287 prescriptions.

From the group of prescriptions, we excluded those containing cladribine and natalizumab.
Cladribine was excluded due to an insufficient sample size; between 2011 and 2015, only
eight individuals received cladribine, with a total of 65 prescriptions issued. Natalizumab was
excluded due to the limited period it was prescribed; after 2013, natalizumab data was
unavailable as it became a hospital-only medication. We excluded 1,361 prescriptions for
natalizumab, which were received by 82 individuals.

Individuals who received a prescription for either natalizumab or cladribine at least once
during the study period (2011–2015) remained in the study if they also received prescriptions
for any other IMD during this period.

The remaining drugs were grouped into three categories: beta interferons and glatiramer
acetate as the injectable group, dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and teriflunomide (TERI) as “other
oral IMDs,” and fingolimod as its own group.

To evaluate our hypotheses, we structured the cohort to include only individuals who
received at least two prescriptions for IMDs within the study period. This approach allowed
us to assess how many days the prescribed quantity between two consecutive prescriptions
for the same drug was sufficient. Consequently, we excluded individuals who received only a
single prescription and dose, as adherence would be challenging to assess accurately with this
method. Notably, 52 individuals received only one prescription for an IMD, while 1,559
individuals received at least two prescriptions, totaling 31,809 prescriptions.
Individuals with only a single prescription could include those who discontinued treatment at
the beginning of the study period, those who started IMD therapy at the end of the study
period, or those who received a one-time IMD dose for any other reason.
We further categorized recipients of IMD prescriptions by the initial date of IMD receipt. In
the prescription database, this is the first recorded date when an individual receives an IMD
prescription, referred to as the index date. The group of 1,559 individuals was split into two
cohorts based on the index date: a naïve cohort and an experienced cohort.
13

The experienced cohort consists of IMD recipients whose therapy start date is unknown and
could precede 2011, for which we have no data. This cohort includes 938 individuals who
received a total of 22,219 prescriptions: 938 received injectable IMDs, 145 received other
oral IMDs excluding fingolimod, and 103 received fingolimod prescriptions. Among the
experienced cohort, 691 individuals did not switch drugs during the study period, while 247
did.

The therapeutic naïve cohort comprises IMD recipients who had not received IMDs at least
180 days before the index date, thus qualifying them as therapeutically naïve. This cohort
includes 621 individuals who received a total of 9,590 prescriptions.

For the survival analysis of drug continuation or substitution, we defined a therapeutic seminaïve cohort, which combines the therapeutic naïve cohort with a subset of the experienced
cohort. This subset includes those who switched drugs within the experienced cohort, with
the next drug they received becoming the starting drug for this cohort. This approach
provided initial treatment dates for persistence assessment and excluded drugs with unknown
start times.

## Ethical Considerations

The acquisition of prescription data was approved based on written assurances of
confidentiality. Names and personal data of individuals in the prescription database were
anonymized for research purposes.

## Research Assumptions and Limitations

The study relies on obtained data, which includes prescription records for each patient,
potentially impacting the accuracy of adherence estimates. We assumed that individuals fully
utilized the medication quantity received in each prescription. The number of days covered
by the prescribed quantity was calculated based on the defined daily dose (DDD) of the drug,
as determined with expert input and the Central Medicines Database. This defined dose may
differ from the actual dose prescribed by the doctor for individual patients. For example,
adherence estimates based on patients’ daily logs may differ from those calculated based on
prescription data (Hansen et al., 2015).
14

We assumed that each individual who received at least two prescriptions for a diseasemodifying drug also has an MS diagnosis.

If an individual stopped receiving MS-modifying drug prescriptions, we assumed they
discontinued treatment. Due to limited data, we did not consider the possibility that they
might have transitioned to hospital-based treatment instead.

We also assumed that the start date of MS treatment is the date before which the individual
had not received an IMD prescription for at least six months prior to the index date. The first
drug prescribed at the index date was considered the first drug received for MS treatment.
For the persistence assessment of individual IMDs, we assumed that an individual
discontinued therapy if more than 180 days elapsed between two consecutive prescriptions
for the same drug. We also assumed therapy discontinuation if at least 180 days passed
between the last received prescription for an IMD and the end of the observation period.
The study is time-bound to the period from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2015, as
determined by the data available, which limits the types of drugs prescribed to MS patients
during this timeframe.

# Adherence to Immunomodulatory Drugs

We measured each patient's adherence to IMDs using the CMA5 method from AdhereR
package in R, during their persistent period. This period was defined as the duration of
consistent use of the same medication (injectable IMD, fingolimod, or other oral IMDs) with
allowed gaps. The permissible gap, during which the patient had no medication available,
was set at up to 180 days. If a patient did not receive medication for 180 days, we assumed
they had discontinued therapy. Thus, the persistence period corresponds to a therapeutic
episode, defined as the time a patient consistently takes the same medication, allowing breaks
of up to 180 days. A therapeutic episode begins with the first redeemed prescription and ends
on the date of the last prescription plus the number of defined daily doses (DDD) issued for
that prescription and any remaining stock from prior prescriptions. We accounted for any
leftover stock from previous prescriptions and transferred it to the next interval between
consecutive prescriptions. The calculated CMA5 values were presented both graphically and
in tables.

The analysis resulted in 2,125 therapeutic episodes. Each patient could have one or more
persistent episodes within the study period, allowing for multiple inclusions per patient.
Specifically, 1,070 patients (68.67%) had one episode, 423 patients (27.13%) had two
episodes, 55 patients (3.53%) had three episodes, and 11 patients (0.70%) had four episodes.
The duration of persistent episodes varied. The average length of therapeutic episodes was
524 days (SD 358) for fingolimod, 1,103 days (SD 625) for injectable IMDs, and 235 days
(SD 132) for other oral IMDs. The percentage of adherent therapeutic episodes was shown
for the entire cohort and stratified by medication type based on different episode lengths.
Among the therapeutic episodes, there were also single-dose prescriptions or prescriptions
followed by a gap longer than the allowed threshold or by the end of the study period. These
cases amounted to 116 episodes (5.46%): 18 (15.51%) in the fingolimod group, 68 (58.62%)
in the injectable group, and 30 (25.86%) in the oral IMD group. Among these, 6 (20%) of
other oral IMD episodes, 11 (61.11%) of fingolimod episodes, and 63 (92.65%) of injectable
episodes were classified as non-persistent. These are single-prescription episodes followed by
discontinuation or a switch in medication, classified as non-persistent. According to the
selected adherence calculation method, adherence cannot be assessed for single-dose
episodes, and these episodes were excluded from further adherence analysis.
16

Descriptive statistics for the estimated adherence during each patient's persistence period are
provided in Figure 2.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align: center;">

![Figure 2: Adherence to IMD](adherence to IMD.png){width=50%} 
</div>
<br><br>

Throughout the study period, a total of 2,009 therapeutic episodes were recorded. Of these,
177 episodes (8.81%) were for fingolimod, 328 episodes (16.32%) were for other oral IMDs,
and 1,504 episodes (74.86%) were for injectable IMDs. The minimum estimated adherence in
the entire cohort was observed among other oral IMDs at 24%, while the maximum
adherence reached 100%. In the study period, 75.36% of episodes were adherent with CMA5
≥ 0.9 (86.90% for oral episodes, 73.40% for injectable episodes, and 85.87% for fingolimod
episodes).

The difference in CMA5 levels between drug groups was statistically significant (H = 56.505;
p < 0.001). Post hoc comparisons between drug pairs were conducted using Bonferroni
correction for pairwise comparisons. The mean rank between fingolimod and injectable drugs
(1,090.16 and 951.38) showed a significant difference (H = –138.782; p = 0.007). CMA5 was
significantly higher for fingolimod therapeutic episodes compared to injectable IMDs. The
CMA5 for oral drugs was also significantly higher than that for injectable drugs (mean ranks
951.38 and 1,204.31, H = –253.535; p < 0.001). The difference between fingolimod and other
oral drugs (mean ranks 1,090.16 and 1,204.31) was not statistically significant (H = –
114.754; p = 0.098).
17

As previously noted, observation windows within the study period varied, leading to
differences in therapeutic episode lengths. Below, we present the estimated CMA5 for each
drug type, categorized by episode length. Figures 3 and 4 provide statistics for CMA5 in
therapeutic episodes that were persistent for up to one year and those that persisted taking
IMD for more than one year.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align: center;">

![Figure 3: Adherence to IMD for those therapeutical episodes that were persistent less than 1 year](adherenca do 1 leta persistence.png){width=50%} 
</div>
<br><br>

Table 3 shows descriptive statistics for therapeutic episodes lasting up to one year, including
the number of therapeutic episodes, minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, median,
and 95% confidence interval of CMA5 for each drug. The proportion of adherent episodes
was 81.70% for fingolimod, 59.90% for injectables, and 86.8% for oral episodes. The median
CMA5 was 0.966 for injectables, 0.968 for fingolimod, and 0.987 for oral therapeutic
episodes. The difference in CMA5 levels based on drug type was statistically significant (H =
29.266; p < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction indicated that
adherence between fingolimod (Ṝ = 245.52) and injectable therapeutic episodes (Ṝ = 214.34)
lasting up to one year was not statistically significant (H = –31.179; p = 0.411). The
difference in CMA5 between fingolimod therapeutic episodes (Ṝ = 245.52) and oral
therapeutic episodes (Ṝ = 287.29) lasting up to one year was also not statistically significant
(H = –41.773; p = 0.123). However, the difference in CMA5 between oral therapeutic
episodes (Ṝ = 287.29) and injectable therapeutic episodes (Ṝ = 214.34) was statistically
18
significant, with adherence in oral therapeutic episodes higher than in injectables (H = –
72.952; p < 0.001).

Table 4 presents adherence metrics for therapeutic episodes lasting more than one year.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align: center;">

![Figure 4: Adherence to IMD for those therapeutical episodes that were persistent more than 1 year](adherence pri vec kot 1 letu persistence.png){width=50%} 
</div>
<br><br>

The proportion of adherent episodes was 88% for fingolimod, 75.4% for injectables, and
85.9% for other oral drugs. The difference in CMA5 levels based on drug type in therapeutic
episodes was statistically significant (H = 14.687; p = 0.001).

Adherence between fingolimod (Ṝ = 860.26) and injectable therapeutic episodes (Ṝ =
735.01) lasting more than one year was statistically significant (H = –125.250; p = 0.008).
However, the difference in CMA5 between therapeutic episodes of fingolimod (Ṝ = 860.26)
and oral drugs (Ṝ = 864.74) lasting more than one year was not statistically significant (H = –
4.481; p = 1). The difference in CMA5 between therapeutic episodes of oral drugs (Ṝ =
864.74) and injectable drugs (Ṝ = 735.01) was statistically significant, with adherence in oral
therapeutic episodes higher than in injectable episodes (H = –129.731; p = 0.03).

Next, we examine adherence differences between pairs of drugs taken by the same patient,
analysing only those who received both combinations of drugs. A total of 136 patients
received both fingolimod and injectable drugs, 224 received both injectables and other oral
drugs, and 6 received both fingolimod and other oral drugs. The estimated CMA5 adherence
data is presented in Figure 5 and Figure 6.
<br><br>

![Figure 6: Adherence to IMD, where patinets were receiving prescriptions for fingolimod and other oral route IMD](adherence to fing and other oral medication.png){width=50%} 
</div>

<br><br>

The difference in adherence between fingolimod and injectable drugs was statistically
significant, with adherence to fingolimod being higher than adherence to injectable drugs (U
= 5466; p = 0.005). Adherence to fingolimod was not higher than adherence to other oral
20
drugs (U = 3; p = 0.1563). Adherence to oral drugs was higher than adherence to injectable
drugs (U = 12910; p = 0.00083).

# Factors Influencing Adherence to Immunomodulatory Drugs

We assessed the impact of the following factors on adherence: patient’s gender, doctor’s
gender, patient’s age, patient’s region of residence, doctor’s specialization, number of
prescriptions per therapeutic episode, average number of defined daily doses (DDD) per
prescription, drug administration type, patient’s sequential medication, and patient’s
sequential therapeutic episode. The dependent variable was the binary CMA5 variable, with
values greater than or equal to 0.9 labeled as adherent and the rest as non-adherent. This
procedure was performed in three separate periods: (1) up to one year, (2) for episodes longer
than one year, and (3) for the entire cohort over the study period. We constructed the logistic
regression model in multiple steps, removing the independent variable that was the least
statistically significant predictor of adherence each time. The optimized model included only
statistically significant variables. The independent variables used for model construction were
not sensitive to different therapeutic episode lengths; thus, only statistically significant
influences on the entire cohort are presented below. Logistic regression results are provided
in Table 1.

<br>
A total of 2,009 therapeutic episodes were included in the analysis. Statistically significant
independent variables included drug type, average number of DDD per prescription, number
of prescriptions per episode, patient’s sequential drug, therapeutic experience as defined by
the patient’s index date, and the duration of the therapeutic episode.
The model's threshold was determined using the Youden index. At an optimal threshold of
0.76, the model’s sensitivity was 71.49%, specificity was 65.67%, and AUC (95% CI) was
74.91% (72.4% – 77.5%).

Drug type significantly influenced patient adherence, with other oral IMDs showing
substantially better adherence than injectable IMDs (OR = 3.478). When accounting for
therapeutic episode duration, therapeutic experience, and sequential medication, there was no
statistically significant difference in adherence between injectable drugs and fingolimod.
Therapeutically experienced patients were, on average, less adherent than therapeutically
naïve patients (OR = 0.301). Additionally, patients with therapeutic episodes longer than one
year were significantly more adherent to their medications than those with episodes up to one
year (OR = 0.406). Patients were more adherent to a subsequent medication than to their first
medication (OR = 2.899).
22

A higher number of prescriptions and a greater number of DDDs increased the likelihood of
adherence in a therapeutic episode (OR = 1.134 / OR = 1.024).


# Persistence of Immunomodulatory Drugs

The proportion of persistent therapeutic episodes was estimated and displayed using the
nonparametric Kaplan-Meier method for time-to-event modeling. Since multiple therapeutic
episodes were included, a patient could appear multiple times in the analysis. Therefore, a
patient who had two therapeutic episodes during the study period was analyzed twice.

First, we estimated the duration of therapeutic episodes until treatment discontinuation.
Therapeutic episodes that were not discontinued during the study period were censored. An
event was defined as treatment discontinuation for any reason, including drug substitution,
reinitiation, or complete discontinuation with allowed gaps up to 180 days.

Only episodes with a clearly defined treatment start date were included. Episodes beginning
less than 180 days before the start of the study period were excluded, as the true start date
was unknown, and the patient may have only been in the allowed gap phase, less than 180
days.

We observed 195 therapeutic episodes for fingolimod, 634 for injectables, and 358 for oral
medications. Figure 7 shows the probability of patients remaining on a selected medication
over a given period. The cohort was stratified by medication type.

Figure 7 illustrates the proportion of therapeutic episodes for each drug that patients
continued to receive at selected time points. Each step on the curve represents an event and
discontinuation of treatment.

At the start of the observation period, at time 0, the probability of not discontinuing treatment
decreased to 94.4% for fingolimod, 98% for oral drugs, and 92.75% for injectables. This is
due to 11 fingolimod initiations without follow-up, followed by an unallowed gap or drug
change. Similarly, there were 46 episodes where an injectable drug was initiated but not
followed up and 7 episodes where a single prescription for an oral drug was filled, followed
by an unallowed gap or drug change.

At six months, 161 therapeutic episodes of fingolimod, 528 of injectables, and 219 of oral
drugs remained uninterrupted. Persistence rates after six months were 92.7% for fingolimod,
87.2% for injectables, and 93.7% for other oral therapeutic episodes.

After one year of medication use, 86.7% (CI 0.81–0.92) of fingolimod episodes, 92.5% (CI
0.89–0.96) of oral episodes, and 78.6% (CI 0.75–0.82) of injectable episodes remained
persistent. This probability stabilizes for other oral IMDs at 309 days.

Fifty percent (CI 45–55%) of therapeutic episodes with injectable IMDs discontinued after 2
years and 8 months. For oral episodes and fingolimod, the median was not reached,
24
indicating that more than 50% of these episodes were not discontinued or switched during the
study period.

One assumption of time-to-event modeling is that all instances have an equal probability at
each moment (van den Reek et al., 2015). Here, this means all medications were available on
the market simultaneously. Medications entered the market at different times from 2011 to
2015. Therefore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis, dividing the study period into two parts:
the first from the beginning of the study period until the end of 2013, and the second
including therapeutic episodes starting after 2013. We also divided the cohort into episodes
where the drug was switched and those with final discontinuation.

Figure 8 shows the cumulative survival probability for fingolimod and injectable therapeutic
episodes. This cohort includes 64 therapeutic episodes of fingolimod and 398 of injectables.
Between 2011 and 2013, patients discontinued 114 injectable episodes, while 284 (71.4%)
were censored. Fourteen fingolimod episodes were discontinued, and 50 (78.1%) were
censored.
25
The number of therapeutic episodes for injectable IMDs and fingolimod did not reach the
median time to discontinuation. Over 50% of therapeutic episodes initiated between 2011 and
2013 were not discontinued before the prescribed treatment.

At six months, 91.4% of injectable episodes and 95.3% of fingolimod episodes were still in
progress. After one year, 86.7% of injectable episodes and 88.8% of fingolimod episodes
persisted. Differences in survival curves were tested with the Log-Rank test (Mantel-Cox),
showing no statistically significant difference between the curves (χ² = 1.439; p = 0.230).

<br><br>

In this cohort in Figure 9, we have 131 therapeutic episodes for fingolimod, 236 for
injectables, and 358 for other oral drugs. Over the entire period, 25 injectable episodes were
discontinued, and 211 (89.4%) were censored. Ten fingolimod episodes were discontinued,
with 121 (92.4%) censored. Fourteen oral therapeutic episodes were discontinued, with 344
(96.1%) censored. The median duration of therapeutic episodes was not reached for any
medication.
26
At six months, 91% of injectable episodes, 94.5% of fingolimod episodes, and 95.5% of oral
episodes persisted without discontinuation. After one year, 89% of injectable episodes, 93.2%
of fingolimod episodes, and 95.4% of oral episodes were still ongoing. The difference in
survival curves was statistically significant (χ² = 45.575; p < 0.001). Post hoc analysis
identified a statistically significant difference between oral IMDs and injectables (χ² = 6.793;
p = 0.009).

Figure 10 shows the percentage of persistent therapeutic episodes of fingolimod and
injectables until drug substitution. There were 64 episodes for fingolimod and 398 for
injectables. In total, 113 injectable episodes were switched, while 285 (71.6%) were
censored. Three fingolimod episodes were substituted, and 61 (95.3%) were censored.
After six months, 97.1% of injectable and 98.4% of fingolimod episodes continued without
substitution. After one year, 95.2% of injectable and 96.8% of fingolimod episodes remained
27

persistent. Differences in survival curves were tested with the Log-Rank test (Mantel-Cox),
showing a statistically significant difference (χ² = 11.196; p = 0.001).

There were 131 therapeutic episodes for fingolimod, 236 for injectables, and 358 for oral
drugs. In total, 55 injectable episodes were substituted, while 181 (76.7%) were censored. Six
fingolimod episodes were substituted, with 125 (95.4%) censored. For oral drugs, 8 episodes
were substituted, and 350 (97.8%) were censored.
The median duration of therapeutic episodes until drug substitution was not reached for any
medication.

After six months, 92.4% of injectable episodes, 97.7% of fingolimod episodes, and 97.7% of
oral episodes continued without substitution. After one year, 79% of injectable episodes,
95.4% of fingolimod episodes, and 96.6% of oral episodes were still in progress. The
difference in survival curves was statistically significant (χ² = 45.909; p < 0.001). Post hoc
28

analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between injectable drugs and the other
two groups. The difference in time until drug substitution was statistically significant between
injectables and fingolimod (χ² = 18.289; p < 0.001) and between injectables and oral drugs (χ²
= 18.289; p < 0.001).

# Factors Influencing Persistence of Immunomodulatory Drugs

Factors influencing drug persistence were modeled using Cox regression. The model was
built on two cohorts, with the entire cohort stratified based on the type of event: whether the
patient discontinued the drug due to substitution with another medication or due to treatment
interruption and reinitiation.

The initial independent variables included in the model were adherence, patient’s age,
doctor’s age, patient’s gender, doctor’s gender, patient’s therapeutic experience, drug type,
number of previous drug substitutions, patient’s sequential therapeutic episode, and the year
the therapeutic episode began. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) method, we
selected the variables that yielded the best-fitting model with the lowest AIC. The results are
shown in Figures 12 and 13.

<br><br> 

<div style="text-align: center;">
![Figure 12:  Risk of Discontinuation or Reinitiation of the Therapeutic Episode with the Same Medication](cox 1.png){width=50%}
</div>

<br><br>

Figure 12 shows that the year of drug initiation has a statistically significant impact on the
risk of discontinuing treatment with the selected drug. Episodes in which patients began
therapy between 2011–2013 have a higher risk of treatment discontinuation compared to
episodes that began in 2014. Conversely, episodes where patients started therapy in 2015
have a lower risk of treatment discontinuation compared to 2014.

Patients have a lower risk of discontinuing therapy if they are receiving a second sequential
medication compared to their first medication. In contrast, patients have a higher risk of
discontinuing therapy if they have previously discontinued treatment for more than 180 days.
It is observed that patients whose prescriptions are issued by female doctors have a slightly
higher risk of discontinuing therapy, though this difference is not statistically significant.
When considering the year of treatment initiation, previous treatments with other
medications, prior discontinuations, and the gender of the prescribing doctor, there is no
30

statistically significant difference in the type of medication affecting the risk of treatment
discontinuation.

The figure below shows the risk of medication substitution.

<br><br> 

<div style="text-align: center;">
![Figure 13: Risk of Medication Substitution](cox 2.png){width=50%}
</div>

<br><br>

Figure 13 shows that the year of drug initiation has a statistically significant impact on the
risk of medication substitution. Therapeutic episodes that began in 2014 represent the highest
risk for drug substitution.

It is observed that patients whose medications are prescribed by female doctors have a
slightly higher risk of therapy substitution, with an OR of 1.53 (CI 1.079–2.17). Additionally,
older patients (51+ years) have a lower risk of switching treatments compared to patients in
the age group 21–40 years, with an OR of 0.38 (CI 0.179–0.81).

When considering the year of therapeutic episode initiation, the gender of the prescribing
doctor, the doctor’s age, and the patient’s age, the difference in substitution risk between
31
medication types is statistically significant. Other oral drugs (TERI and DMF) and
fingolimod have a statistically significantly lower risk of substitution than injectable drugs,
with ORs of 0.23 (CI 0.099–0.54) and 0.18 (CI 0.092–0.36), respectively.

# Interpretation and discussion

## Evaluation of Hypotheses
In formulating the hypotheses, we referred to existing literature, which suggests better
adherence to newer oral medications and fingolimod compared to older injectable IMDs. Due
to different timelines for drug availability on global and Slovenian markets, there are
variations in the lengths of therapeutic episodes in which patients consistently receive IMDs.
The average duration of episodes for other oral IMDs is shorter than for the other two IMD
groups. Adherence appears to be sensitive to therapeutic episode duration, so we stratified
episodes into two groups for hypothesis evaluation.

The first hypothesis aimed to verify if adherence to other oral MS drugs (TERI and DMF) is
higher than adherence to injectable IMDs. Results indicate significantly higher adherence to
oral (TERI and DMF) compared to injectable IMDs for therapeutic episodes lasting up to one
year (p < 0.001) and more than one year (p = 0.03). Among patients who received both
injectable and oral IMDs, adherence to oral drugs was also higher than adherence to
injectables (p < 0.001). These results align with a study by Lahdenperä et al. (2020), which
showed that patients are more adherent to oral IMDs than injectables. Side effects and the
fear of self-injecting IMDs are potential reasons for lower adherence to injectables. In a study
by Ibrahim & Deleu (2018), a majority of patients (39.2%) cited fear of injections as a
primary reason for non-adherence, followed by insufficient instructions from prescribers.
Magdič et al. (2015) examined the acceptability of new oral IMDs (TERI and DMF), finding
similar results that indicated better tolerance of oral IMDs (TERI and DMF) compared to
injectables.

The second hypothesis examines adherence differences between fingolimod and other oral
medications (DMF and TERI). The analysis of consistent use between fingolimod and other
oral IMDs (TERI and DMF) revealed no significant differences between the two groups.
Adherence to all oral IMDs (TERI and DMF) in the Slovenian population was high,
averaging 95%, with only 14.13% and 13.1% of fingolimod and other oral IMD episodes
32
being non-adherent, regardless of persistence duration. Similar findings were presented in a
study by Ortega-Garcia et al. (2020), which showed comparable adherence among
fingolimod, TERI, and DMF.

The third hypothesis aimed to verify if adherence to fingolimod is higher than adherence to
injectable MS IMDs. Results show that patients are more adherent to fingolimod than
injectable IMDs in the long term (p = 0.008). There is no difference in adherence for episodes
lasting less than one year (p = 0.411). Among patients who received both fingolimod and
injectables, adherence to fingolimod was better (p = 0.005). In these cases, drug substitution
was primarily due to treatment escalation and worsening symptoms, as fingolimod is
registered as a second-line drug in Slovenia. Comparable findings were observed in similar
retrospective studies. Bergvall et al. (2014) conducted a study on the U.S. population
showing higher adherence to fingolimod than injectables, regardless of methodology (PDC or
MPR) and using an adherence threshold of 0.8. The authors note that higher adherence
reflects fingolimod’s effectiveness and convenient once-daily dosing. Higuera et al. (2016)
found that the ineffectiveness and side effects at the injection site contribute to lower
adherence to injectables.

Based on these findings, we confirm hypothesis H_1, reject H_2, and partially confirm H_3,
as there is no adherence difference between injectables and fingolimod for episodes lasting
less than one year.

## Persistence of Medications

The proportion of persistent therapeutic episodes after six months was 92.7% for fingolimod,
87.2% for injectables, and 93.7% for other oral IMDs. After one year, these values were
86.7%, 78.6%, and 92.5%, respectively. This rate reflects treatment continuity for a selected
medication, regardless of the reason (complete discontinuation or substitution). Over the
entire study period, the proportion of discontinued fingolimod episodes was 27.44% (fouryear period), injectable IMDs 70.13% (five-year period), and other oral IMDs (DMF and
TERI) 7.51% (1.5-year period).

## Factors Influencing Adherence

The most important factor influencing adherence is the type of medication received. When
considering other variables, oral IMDs (TERI and DMF) and fingolimod positively impact
33
adherence compared to injectable IMDs. Experienced IMD users were less adherent. These
patients had been receiving IMDs before the study period, primarily injectables, due to
fingolimod and other oral IMDs not yet being available on the market. With each medication
change, adherence to the next medication, typically an oral IMD (fingolimod, TERI, or
DMF), improved, as seen in the Canadian population in the study by Setayeshgar et al.
(2019). Similarly, Agashivala et al. (2013) showed that patients are more adherent to their
current medication if they previously received an injectable IMD. The study also found that
longer therapeutic episodes were less adherent, likely reflecting the longer duration of
injectable IMD episodes and potential inefficacy and side effects leading to missed doses.

## Limitations

This study has limitations related to accessible data tied to issued prescriptions, which may
not reflect actual medication use. Additionally, it would be beneficial to understand the
causes of reduced adherence and persistence to IMDs. Future studies could incorporate data
on each patient’s exact diagnosis, clinical progression, reported side effects, and
comorbidities. Analyzing over a longer period could mitigate the impact of new drugs
gradually entering the market, allowing for a more comprehensive observation period for
specific IMDs. A key advantage of this study is its large sample size, capturing all MS
patients who received IMD prescriptions in the Slovenian population between 2011 and 2015.


# Conclusion

In this master's thesis, we conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of IMD prescriptions in
the Slovenian population from 2011 to 2015. Using the selected methodology, we evaluated
adherence and persistence to the IMDs prescribed during this period. Results showed better
adherence and persistence for other oral drugs (TERI and DMF) compared to injectable
medications. Fingolimod also proved to have a lower risk of substitution with another drug
and demonstrated higher long-term adherence than injectable IMDs. The most significant
factor influencing adherence was found to be the type of medication, followed by drug
substitution. Patients tended to be more adherent to the second medication they received than
the first. Patients who started injectable IMDs after 2013, when all drugs were available on
the Slovenian market, were more likely to discontinue or switch medications compared to the
other two types. Younger patients exhibited the highest risk of therapy substitution, raising
questions about the reasons why patients frequently switch or discontinue IMD treatment.
34

The findings of this research provide insight into the dynamics of IMD use among MS
patients and are useful for planning prescription strategies for MS patients. This study
contributes to the literature as no similar study has been conducted on the entire Slovenian
population.
