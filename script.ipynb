    "# Introduction and Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous\n",
    "system and is one of the most common causes of disability among young adults (Wingerchuk\n",
    "& Carter, 2014). Most often, the diagnosis is made in individuals between the ages of 20 and\n",
    "40 (Jazbec, 2016), a period crucial for active participation in the workforce. According to\n",
    "data from the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform, up to 80% of patients stop working\n",
    "within 15 years of disease onset (European Multiple Sclerosis Platform [EMSP], 2015),\n",
    "which can impact the economic and social aspects of society.\n",
    "While there is no cure for MS, medications are available that can modify the course of the\n",
    "disease, control it to some extent, and help manage symptoms. Consistent adherence to\n",
    "prescribed doses plays a crucial role in managing disease progression, reducing relapse rates,\n",
    "and slowing disability progression (Banks et al., 2019). This measurable phenomenon,\n",
    "defined as adherence, is essential for positive health outcomes. Previous studies have\n",
    "indicated suboptimal long-term adherence to medications that modify the course of chronic\n",
    "diseases (Menzin et al., 2013). Injectable medications can pose adherence challenges due to\n",
    "side effects, such as flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions (Agashivala et al., 2013;\n",
    "Menzin et al., 2013). Current treatment guidelines emphasize the importance of early and\n",
    "continuous use of prescribed immunomodulatory drugs (IMDs) from the time of diagnosis.\n",
    "Early treatment has been shown to improve disease outcomes, reduce relapse rates, prevent\n",
    "demyelinating lesions, and slow disease progression (Tan et al., 2011). In chronic diseases,\n",
    "adherence to prescribed doses is crucial for influencing disease progression and,\n",
    "consequently, healthcare costs for society (Menzin et al., 2013).\n",
    "In recent years, there has been a growing trend in using pharmaceutical and healthcare\n",
    "databases to monitor medication consumption (McKay et al., 2017). Various approaches have\n",
    "been developed to identify medication usage intensity, discontinuation, and duration of\n",
    "treatment.\n",
    "The study by Hansen et al. (2015) presents an adherence analysis of four IMDs prescribed for\n",
    "MS in Germany over a two-year period. Results showed that only 30-40% of patients\n",
    "remained adherent two years after starting the medication. A similar study was conducted by\n",
    "Setayeshgar et al. (2019) in Canada, where adherence was measured based on prescribed\n",
    "6\n",
    "doses for MS patients from 2011 to 2015. Findings indicated a high adherence rate (> 80%)\n",
    "among patients who did not discontinue therapy during the first year.\n",
    "In this research, we aim to evaluate and analyze the dynamics of prescribed IMD doses for\n",
    "MS treatment based on a database of all issued prescriptions from 2011 to 2015. This data\n",
    "enables a faster and more cost-effective research approach that includes a large sample. The\n",
    "findings of this study provide insight into the dynamics of IMD use in MS treatment and aid\n",
    "in planning prescription strategies for MS patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objectives and goals of the thesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this research is to analyze the usage dynamics of immunomodulatory drugs\n",
    "(IMDs) and the demographic characteristics of MS patients receiving these drugs based on\n",
    "prescription data. Using prescription data from Slovenia from 2011 to 2015, we aim to\n",
    "evaluate adherence and persistence to these drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals of the Thesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyze the prescribing trends of IMDs for MS patients.\n",
    "2. Assess adherence to IMDs among MS patients.\n",
    "3. Determine whether adherence to MS treatment with IMDs differs by drug\n",
    "administration type.\n",
    "4. Estimate the survival probability of specific IMDs until substitution or treatment\n",
    "discontinuation (persistence).\n",
    "5. Identify factors influencing adherence and persistence of IMDs for MS.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "In chronic diseases, patient adherence to the prescribed therapeutic regimen impacts disease\n",
    "outcomes. Therefore, treatments must be designed to be safe and effective for patients. Since\n",
    "various IMDs are available on the market, we sought to evaluate adherence differences\n",
    "between older injectable IMDs and newer oral IMDs, both of which are prescribed as firstline treatments. Additionally, we examined fingolimod, which has shown high efficacy,\n",
    "7\n",
    "particularly if administered at the onset of MS symptoms. Since fingolimod is prescribed as a\n",
    "first-line drug in some countries and a second-line drug in others, we were interested in\n",
    "comparing patient adherence to fingolimod with that of the other two drug types. \n",
    "The hypotheses we aim to test are:\n",
    "\n",
    "• H_1: Adherence to oral IMDs prescribed for MS patients is higher than adherence to\n",
    "injectable IMDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "• H_2: Adherence to fingolimod is higher than adherence to other oral drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "• H_3: Adherence to fingolimod is higher than adherence to injectable drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Research methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Methods and Statistical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous numerical variables with normal distributions are presented with the mean and\n",
    "standard deviation. For non-normally distributed variables, we report the median and 95%\n",
    "confidence interval. Categorical variables are shown as absolute and relative frequencies.\n",
    "Adherence was estimated based on the CMA5 method defined by Vollmer et al. (2012). The\n",
    "permissible gap defining persistence in a therapeutic episode is set at 180 days. The length of\n",
    "a therapeutic episode, or persistence, is defined as the period from the first prescription to the\n",
    "last prescription plus the quantity dispensed at the last prescription, including any surplus or\n",
    "medication stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adherence is shown as the percentage of adherent therapeutic episodes, with a threshold of\n",
    "90%. We used the function cma.per.episode from the AdhereR package, setting the\n",
    "permissible gap to 180 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated adherence is summarized with the median, mean, minimum, maximum, and\n",
    "95% confidence interval. The proportion of adherent patients within each drug group at the\n",
    "90% threshold is also displayed. Hypothesis evaluation was conducted using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. In cases where the test was statistically significant, we\n",
    "performed post hoc analysis with Bonferroni correction for p-values. Paired tests for\n",
    "evaluating adherence between drug groups for the same patient were conducted using the\n",
    "non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The impact of independent variables on adherence\n",
    "was modeled with multivariate logistic regression. The influences of selected independent\n",
    "variables on the dichotomous variable CMA5 were modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient persistence to drugs was illustrated with Kaplan-Meier survival curves, from which\n",
    "the proportion of persistent patients was determined. The impact of independent variables on\n",
    "non-persistence was assessed with multivariate Cox regression, where events defining the end\n",
    "of persistence were classified as complete treatment discontinuation or drug substitution. The\n",
    "analysis was conducted on both the entire study period and two separate periods within the\n",
    "study: 2011–2013 and 2014–2015. Statistical significance of differences in times to treatment\n",
    "substitution or discontinuation was assessed with the non-parametric Mantel-Cox log-rank\n",
    "test.\n",
    "9\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical significance is considered at p ≤ 0.05. The statistical analysis was performed using\n",
    "RStudio (RStudio Team, 2021), R version 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2019), and IBM SPSS\n",
    "Statistics version 27.0 (IBM Corp, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "The retrospective study was based on a database of outpatient prescriptions from 2011 to\n",
    "2015. The prescription database includes demographic data of recipients and prescribers,\n",
    "along with details of the issued prescriptions. For each prescription, the database records the\n",
    "ATC code of the dispensed drug, its quantity, and the prescription issue date. Using the drug\n",
    "code, we obtained the defined daily dose (DDD) per drug package from the Central\n",
    "Medicines Database. Based on the DDD and the number of packages dispensed, we estimated\n",
    "the DDD prescribed per prescription, which indicates the number of days for which the\n",
    "prescribed drug is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cohort Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "MS medications were identified based on ATC codes with guidance from clinical experts.\n",
    "The identified active substances in our data include interferon beta-1a (ATC L03AB07),\n",
    "interferon beta-1b (ATC L03AB08), glatiramer acetate (ATC L03AX13), dimethyl fumarate\n",
    "(ATC N07XX09), teriflunomide (ATC L04AA31), fingolimod (ATC L04AA27), natalizumab\n",
    "(ATC L04AA23), and cladribine (ATC L01BB04).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset preparation process and cohort design are illustrated in Figure 1.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1: Cohort definition](kohort definition.png){width=50%} \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Figure 1, we observe that the database contains 33,287 prescriptions for one of the\n",
    "immunomodulatory drugs (IMDs) intended to modify the course of multiple sclerosis (MS).\n",
    "A total of 1,634 individuals received these 33,287 prescriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the group of prescriptions, we excluded those containing cladribine and natalizumab.\n",
    "Cladribine was excluded due to an insufficient sample size; between 2011 and 2015, only\n",
    "eight individuals received cladribine, with a total of 65 prescriptions issued. Natalizumab was\n",
    "excluded due to the limited period it was prescribed; after 2013, natalizumab data was\n",
    "unavailable as it became a hospital-only medication. We excluded 1,361 prescriptions for\n",
    "natalizumab, which were received by 82 individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals who received a prescription for either natalizumab or cladribine at least once\n",
    "during the study period (2011–2015) remained in the study if they also received prescriptions\n",
    "for any other IMD during this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining drugs were grouped into three categories: beta interferons and glatiramer\n",
    "acetate as the injectable group, dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and teriflunomide (TERI) as “other\n",
    "oral IMDs,” and fingolimod as its own group.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate our hypotheses, we structured the cohort to include only individuals who\n",
    "received at least two prescriptions for IMDs within the study period. This approach allowed\n",
    "us to assess how many days the prescribed quantity between two consecutive prescriptions\n",
    "for the same drug was sufficient. Consequently, we excluded individuals who received only a\n",
    "single prescription and dose, as adherence would be challenging to assess accurately with this\n",
    "method. Notably, 52 individuals received only one prescription for an IMD, while 1,559\n",
    "individuals received at least two prescriptions, totaling 31,809 prescriptions.\n",
    "Individuals with only a single prescription could include those who discontinued treatment at\n",
    "the beginning of the study period, those who started IMD therapy at the end of the study\n",
    "period, or those who received a one-time IMD dose for any other reason.\n",
    "We further categorized recipients of IMD prescriptions by the initial date of IMD receipt. In\n",
    "the prescription database, this is the first recorded date when an individual receives an IMD\n",
    "prescription, referred to as the index date. The group of 1,559 individuals was split into two\n",
    "cohorts based on the index date: a naïve cohort and an experienced cohort.\n",
    "13\n",
    "\n",
    "The experienced cohort consists of IMD recipients whose therapy start date is unknown and\n",
    "could precede 2011, for which we have no data. This cohort includes 938 individuals who\n",
    "received a total of 22,219 prescriptions: 938 received injectable IMDs, 145 received other\n",
    "oral IMDs excluding fingolimod, and 103 received fingolimod prescriptions. Among the\n",
    "experienced cohort, 691 individuals did not switch drugs during the study period, while 247\n",
    "did.\n",
    "\n",
    "The therapeutic naïve cohort comprises IMD recipients who had not received IMDs at least\n",
    "180 days before the index date, thus qualifying them as therapeutically naïve. This cohort\n",
    "includes 621 individuals who received a total of 9,590 prescriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the survival analysis of drug continuation or substitution, we defined a therapeutic seminaïve cohort, which combines the therapeutic naïve cohort with a subset of the experienced\n",
    "cohort. This subset includes those who switched drugs within the experienced cohort, with\n",
    "the next drug they received becoming the starting drug for this cohort. This approach\n",
    "provided initial treatment dates for persistence assessment and excluded drugs with unknown\n",
    "start times.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The acquisition of prescription data was approved based on written assurances of\n",
    "confidentiality. Names and personal data of individuals in the prescription database were\n",
    "anonymized for research purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Assumptions and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The study relies on obtained data, which includes prescription records for each patient,\n",
    "potentially impacting the accuracy of adherence estimates. We assumed that individuals fully\n",
    "utilized the medication quantity received in each prescription. The number of days covered\n",
    "by the prescribed quantity was calculated based on the defined daily dose (DDD) of the drug,\n",
    "as determined with expert input and the Central Medicines Database. This defined dose may\n",
    "differ from the actual dose prescribed by the doctor for individual patients. For example,\n",
    "adherence estimates based on patients’ daily logs may differ from those calculated based on\n",
    "prescription data (Hansen et al., 2015).\n",
    "14\n",
    "\n",
    "We assumed that each individual who received at least two prescriptions for a diseasemodifying drug also has an MS diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an individual stopped receiving MS-modifying drug prescriptions, we assumed they\n",
    "discontinued treatment. Due to limited data, we did not consider the possibility that they\n",
    "might have transitioned to hospital-based treatment instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also assumed that the start date of MS treatment is the date before which the individual\n",
    "had not received an IMD prescription for at least six months prior to the index date. The first\n",
    "drug prescribed at the index date was considered the first drug received for MS treatment.\n",
    "For the persistence assessment of individual IMDs, we assumed that an individual\n",
    "discontinued therapy if more than 180 days elapsed between two consecutive prescriptions\n",
    "for the same drug. We also assumed therapy discontinuation if at least 180 days passed\n",
    "between the last received prescription for an IMD and the end of the observation period.\n",
    "The study is time-bound to the period from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2015, as\n",
    "determined by the data available, which limits the types of drugs prescribed to MS patients\n",
    "during this timeframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adherence to Immunomodulatory Drugs\n",
    "\n",
    "We measured each patient's adherence to IMDs using the CMA5 method from AdhereR\n",
    "package in R, during their persistent period. This period was defined as the duration of\n",
    "consistent use of the same medication (injectable IMD, fingolimod, or other oral IMDs) with\n",
    "allowed gaps. The permissible gap, during which the patient had no medication available,\n",
    "was set at up to 180 days. If a patient did not receive medication for 180 days, we assumed\n",
    "they had discontinued therapy. Thus, the persistence period corresponds to a therapeutic\n",
    "episode, defined as the time a patient consistently takes the same medication, allowing breaks\n",
    "of up to 180 days. A therapeutic episode begins with the first redeemed prescription and ends\n",
    "on the date of the last prescription plus the number of defined daily doses (DDD) issued for\n",
    "that prescription and any remaining stock from prior prescriptions. We accounted for any\n",
    "leftover stock from previous prescriptions and transferred it to the next interval between\n",
    "consecutive prescriptions. The calculated CMA5 values were presented both graphically and\n",
    "in tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis resulted in 2,125 therapeutic episodes. Each patient could have one or more\n",
    "persistent episodes within the study period, allowing for multiple inclusions per patient.\n",
    "Specifically, 1,070 patients (68.67%) had one episode, 423 patients (27.13%) had two\n",
    "episodes, 55 patients (3.53%) had three episodes, and 11 patients (0.70%) had four episodes.\n",
    "The duration of persistent episodes varied. The average length of therapeutic episodes was\n",
    "524 days (SD 358) for fingolimod, 1,103 days (SD 625) for injectable IMDs, and 235 days\n",
    "(SD 132) for other oral IMDs. The percentage of adherent therapeutic episodes was shown\n",
    "for the entire cohort and stratified by medication type based on different episode lengths.\n",
    "Among the therapeutic episodes, there were also single-dose prescriptions or prescriptions\n",
    "followed by a gap longer than the allowed threshold or by the end of the study period. These\n",
    "cases amounted to 116 episodes (5.46%): 18 (15.51%) in the fingolimod group, 68 (58.62%)\n",
    "in the injectable group, and 30 (25.86%) in the oral IMD group. Among these, 6 (20%) of\n",
    "other oral IMD episodes, 11 (61.11%) of fingolimod episodes, and 63 (92.65%) of injectable\n",
    "episodes were classified as non-persistent. These are single-prescription episodes followed by\n",
    "discontinuation or a switch in medication, classified as non-persistent. According to the\n",
    "selected adherence calculation method, adherence cannot be assessed for single-dose\n",
    "episodes, and these episodes were excluded from further adherence analysis.\n",
    "16\n",
    "\n",

    "and 1,504 episodes (74.86%) were for injectable IMDs. The minimum estimated adherence in\n",
    "the entire cohort was observed among other oral IMDs at 24%, while the maximum\n",
    "adherence reached 100%. In the study period, 75.36% of episodes were adherent with CMA5\n",

    "# Interpretation and discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation of Hypotheses\n",
    "In formulating the hypotheses, we referred to existing literature, which suggests better\n",
    "adherence to newer oral medications and fingolimod compared to older injectable IMDs. Due\n",
    "to different timelines for drug availability on global and Slovenian markets, there are\n",
    "variations in the lengths of therapeutic episodes in which patients consistently receive IMDs.\n",
    "The average duration of episodes for other oral IMDs is shorter than for the other two IMD\n",
    "groups. Adherence appears to be sensitive to therapeutic episode duration, so we stratified\n",
    "episodes into two groups for hypothesis evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first hypothesis aimed to verify if adherence to other oral MS drugs (TERI and DMF) is\n",
    "higher than adherence to injectable IMDs. Results indicate significantly higher adherence to\n",
    "oral (TERI and DMF) compared to injectable IMDs for therapeutic episodes lasting up to one\n",
    "year (p < 0.001) and more than one year (p = 0.03). Among patients who received both\n",
    "injectable and oral IMDs, adherence to oral drugs was also higher than adherence to\n",
    "injectables (p < 0.001). These results align with a study by Lahdenperä et al. (2020), which\n",
    "showed that patients are more adherent to oral IMDs than injectables. Side effects and the\n",
    "fear of self-injecting IMDs are potential reasons for lower adherence to injectables. In a study\n",
    "by Ibrahim & Deleu (2018), a majority of patients (39.2%) cited fear of injections as a\n",
    "primary reason for non-adherence, followed by insufficient instructions from prescribers.\n",
    "Magdič et al. (2015) examined the acceptability of new oral IMDs (TERI and DMF), finding\n",
    "similar results that indicated better tolerance of oral IMDs (TERI and DMF) compared to\n",
    "injectables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second hypothesis examines adherence differences between fingolimod and other oral\n",
    "medications (DMF and TERI). The analysis of consistent use between fingolimod and other\n",
    "oral IMDs (TERI and DMF) revealed no significant differences between the two groups.\n",
    "Adherence to all oral IMDs (TERI and DMF) in the Slovenian population was high,\n",
    "averaging 95%, with only 14.13% and 13.1% of fingolimod and other oral IMD episodes\n",
    "32\n",
    "being non-adherent, regardless of persistence duration. Similar findings were presented in a\n",
    "study by Ortega-Garcia et al. (2020), which showed comparable adherence among\n",
    "fingolimod, TERI, and DMF.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third hypothesis aimed to verify if adherence to fingolimod is higher than adherence to\n",
    "injectable MS IMDs. Results show that patients are more adherent to fingolimod than\n",
    "injectable IMDs in the long term (p = 0.008). There is no difference in adherence for episodes\n",
    "lasting less than one year (p = 0.411). Among patients who received both fingolimod and\n",
    "injectables, adherence to fingolimod was better (p = 0.005). In these cases, drug substitution\n",
    "was primarily due to treatment escalation and worsening symptoms, as fingolimod is\n",
    "registered as a second-line drug in Slovenia. Comparable findings were observed in similar\n",
    "retrospective studies. Bergvall et al. (2014) conducted a study on the U.S. population\n",
    "showing higher adherence to fingolimod than injectables, regardless of methodology (PDC or\n",
    "MPR) and using an adherence threshold of 0.8. The authors note that higher adherence\n",
    "reflects fingolimod’s effectiveness and convenient once-daily dosing. Higuera et al. (2016)\n",
    "found that the ineffectiveness and side effects at the injection site contribute to lower\n",
    "adherence to injectables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these findings, we confirm hypothesis H_1, reject H_2, and partially confirm H_3,\n",
    "as there is no adherence difference between injectables and fingolimod for episodes lasting\n",
    "less than one year.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Persistence of Medications\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportion of persistent therapeutic episodes after six months was 92.7% for fingolimod,\n",
    "87.2% for injectables, and 93.7% for other oral IMDs. After one year, these values were\n",
    "86.7%, 78.6%, and 92.5%, respectively. This rate reflects treatment continuity for a selected\n",
    "medication, regardless of the reason (complete discontinuation or substitution). Over the\n",
    "entire study period, the proportion of discontinued fingolimod episodes was 27.44% (fouryear period), injectable IMDs 70.13% (five-year period), and other oral IMDs (DMF and\n",
    "TERI) 7.51% (1.5-year period).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factors Influencing Adherence\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important factor influencing adherence is the type of medication received. When\n",
    "considering other variables, oral IMDs (TERI and DMF) and fingolimod positively impact\n",
    "33\n",
    "adherence compared to injectable IMDs. Experienced IMD users were less adherent. These\n",
    "patients had been receiving IMDs before the study period, primarily injectables, due to\n",
    "fingolimod and other oral IMDs not yet being available on the market. With each medication\n",
    "change, adherence to the next medication, typically an oral IMD (fingolimod, TERI, or\n",
    "DMF), improved, as seen in the Canadian population in the study by Setayeshgar et al.\n",
    "(2019). Similarly, Agashivala et al. (2013) showed that patients are more adherent to their\n",
    "current medication if they previously received an injectable IMD. The study also found that\n",
    "longer therapeutic episodes were less adherent, likely reflecting the longer duration of\n",
    "injectable IMD episodes and potential inefficacy and side effects leading to missed doses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "This study has limitations related to accessible data tied to issued prescriptions, which may\n",
    "not reflect actual medication use. Additionally, it would be beneficial to understand the\n",
    "causes of reduced adherence and persistence to IMDs. Future studies could incorporate data\n",
    "on each patient’s exact diagnosis, clinical progression, reported side effects, and\n",
    "comorbidities. Analyzing over a longer period could mitigate the impact of new drugs\n",
    "gradually entering the market, allowing for a more comprehensive observation period for\n",
    "specific IMDs. A key advantage of this study is its large sample size, capturing all MS\n",
    "patients who received IMD prescriptions in the Slovenian population between 2011 and 2015."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this master's thesis, we conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of IMD prescriptions in\n",
    "the Slovenian population from 2011 to 2015. Using the selected methodology, we evaluated\n",
    "adherence and persistence to the IMDs prescribed during this period. Results showed better\n",
    "adherence and persistence for other oral drugs (TERI and DMF) compared to injectable\n",
    "medications. Fingolimod also proved to have a lower risk of substitution with another drug\n",
    "and demonstrated higher long-term adherence than injectable IMDs. The most significant\n",
    "factor influencing adherence was found to be the type of medication, followed by drug\n",
    "substitution. Patients tended to be more adherent to the second medication they received than\n",
    "the first. Patients who started injectable IMDs after 2013, when all drugs were available on\n",
    "the Slovenian market, were more likely to discontinue or switch medications compared to the\n",
    "other two types. Younger patients exhibited the highest risk of therapy substitution, raising\n",
    "questions about the reasons why patients frequently switch or discontinue IMD treatment.\n",
    "34\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of this research provide insight into the dynamics of IMD use among MS\n",
    "patients and are useful for planning prescription strategies for MS patients. This study\n",
    "contributes to the literature as no similar study has been conducted on the entire Slovenian\n",
    "population."
